# WPC Qi 1.3 Authentication protocol with</br> OPTIGA&trade; Trust Charge

## Description

This application note demonstrates partial immplementatio of the WPC Qi 1.3 Authentication Flow with help of the OPTIGA&trade; Trust Charge device authentication solution.
In paricular this AppNote shows several things:
* API to form correct messages according to the WPC Qi 1.3. Authentication. It's important to highlight, that this code doesn't implement the authentication flow itself, rather just prepares messages whcih might be forwarded to the respective endpoint.
* Example usage of the API with a test flow
* Test Vectors against the API

WPC Qi 1.3 API Description can be found [here](WPC-Qi-Authentication-API.md)

## Hardware Setup

For this AppNote, you need an official OPTIGA&trade; Trust Charge [Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/optiga-trust-ch-eval-kit/)

## Software Setup

### Install DAVE IDE

Note that DAVE is supported on Windows platforms.

Go to Infineon's DAVE software download page.

Choose the DAVE package for your operating system and submit your registration information. After you register, you should receive a confirmation email with a link to download a .zip file.

Download the DAVE package .zip file (DAVE_version_os_date.zip), and unzip it to the location where you want to install DAVE (for example, C:\DAVE4). Note
Some Windows users have reported problems using Windows Explorer to unzip the file. We recommend that you use a third-party program such as 7-Zip.

To launch DAVE, run the executable file found in the unzipped DAVE_version_os_date.zip folder.

Go to the next Section to install JLink

### Install SEGGER J-Link

To communicate with the XMC4700 Relax Kit's on-board debugging probe, you need the drivers included in the J-Link Software and Documentation pack. You can download the J-Link Software and Documentation pack from Segger's J-Link [software download page](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack).

### Additional Software References

For more information on DAVE IDE, see the [DAVE Quick Start Guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-DAVE_Quick_Start-GS-v02_00-EN.pdf) and visit [DAVE Forum](https://www.infineonforums.com/threads/6212-Install-DAVE%C2%99-IDE-for-XMC%C2%99-microcontrollers).

##  Setting up your hardware

To set up the OPTIGA&trade; Trust Charge Evaluation Kit:

Connect your computer to the Debugger Micro USB port on your XMC4700 RelaxKit. The On-board USB debug probe is used to program the board.

For logging purpose please connect additional USB cable to the X100 Connector on the board (an opposite side of the board).

Ensure that the Shield2Go Security OPTIGAâ„¢ Trust Charge in Socket 1 of the Infineon MyIoT Adapter

## Establishing a serial connection for debugging

The Demo project creates an USB HID device which can be opened in a tool like Terra Term.

## Downloading the Code

To get the code you need either download one of existing releases or Git CLone this repository.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/infineon/wpcqi-optiga-trust-charge`

## Importing the WPC Qi 1.3 Auth AppNote project into DAVE

1. Start DAVE.

2. In DAVE, choose File, and then choose Import. Expand the Infineon folder, choose DAVE Project, and then choose Next.

3. In the Import DAVE Projects window, choose Select Root Directory, choose Browse, and then choose the XMC4700 demo project.

4. In the directory where you have your cloned/dwnloaded sources the XMC4700 demo project is located in `projects/xmc4700_relax_kit_qi_auth_example/`

5. Make sure that Copy Projects Into Workspace is cleared.

6. Choose Finish.

The `xmc4700_qi_auth_example` project should be imported into your workspace and activated.

## Selecting the right Build configuration

The demo project tests the implementaion of both sides PRx and PTX at the same time. However there is one detail, the Power Receiver can optionaly do all crypto relevat function either using OPTIGA or Third Party Crypto library as backend. You can choose it by selecting the corresponding configuration: Right CLick on the Project and select "Build Configurations" -> "Set Active" -> Make a choise between either `optiga_prx_crypto` or `software_prx_crypto`
Please note that performance of the pure software based approach is significantly slower than the configuration based on the Security Element
